## What Proxima is not
The desire has always been for a distributed proxy encoding application.
Proxima provides a good example for handling Resolve's data and passing it to a distribute framework.
Perhaps it has potential as a starting point for integrating Resolve with other distributed applications, like:

- stabilisation
- optical flow 
- machine learning

Proxima itself should probably only ever deal with proxies though.
Its core integration mechanism is simple: linking proxies. 
Some specialised handlers would be required to integrate new video assets non-destructively.
Integration through Fusion may be a good route, but one that deviates too far from Proxima's core strengths.
